# Education Module Seeders

This document explains how to use the Prisma seeders for the education module.

## Overview

The education module includes 4 main seeders that create a complete educational experience:

1. **CourseSeeder** - Creates educational courses
2. **ModuleSeeder** - Creates modules within courses
3. **ContentItemSeeder** - Creates learning content for modules
4. **QuizSeeder** - Creates quiz questions and options for content

## Seeded Data

### Courses (8 courses)

- Financial Literacy Basics
- Investment Fundamentals
- Budgeting Mastery
- Debt Management Strategies
- Retirement Planning
- Emergency Fund Essentials
- Understanding Credit
- Tax Planning Basics

### Modules (16 modules)

- 4 modules for Financial Literacy Basics
- 4 modules for Investment Fundamentals
- 3 modules for Budgeting Mastery
- 3 modules for Debt Management
- 3 modules for Emergency Fund Essentials

### Content Items (7 detailed content items)

- Rich markdown content with educational material
- Step-by-step guides and explanations
- Real-world examples and tips

### Quiz Questions (10 questions with 40 options)

- Multiple choice questions to test comprehension
- Detailed explanations for each answer
- Covers key concepts from the content

## Usage

### Seed Education Data Only

```bash
# Navigate to core-api directory
cd core-api

# Seed only education module data
npm run seed:education

# Clear only education module data
npm run seed:education:clear
```

### Seed All Data (Including Education)

```bash
# Seed all application data
npm run seed

# Clear all seed data
npm run seed:clear
```

### Manual Execution

```bash
# Seed education data
npx tsx src/infraestructure/seeds/educationSeeder.ts seed

# Clear education data
npx tsx src/infraestructure/seeds/educationSeeder.ts clear
```

## Dependencies

The seeders must be run in order due to foreign key constraints:

1. **Courses** (independent)
2. **Modules** (requires courses)
3. **ContentItems** (requires modules)
4. **Quizzes** (requires content items)

The seeders handle this automatically and will skip seeding if data already exists.

## Testing the Data

After seeding, you can test the education module:

1. **Start the API server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test endpoints**:

   ```bash
   # Get all courses
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/courses

   # Get course by ID
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/courses/1

   # Get modules for a course
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/modules?courseId=1
   ```

3. **Test in the mobile app**:
   - Navigate to the Learn tab
   - Browse available courses
   - Enroll in a course
   - View modules and content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign key constraint errors**:
   - Make sure to run seeders in order
   - Clear data before re-seeding if needed

2. **"Already exists" messages**:
   - Seeders skip if data exists
   - Use clear commands to reset data

3. **Database connection errors**:
   - Ensure your database is running
   - Check your DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Logs

The seeders provide detailed logging:

- ‚úÖ Success messages with counts
- üìö Progress indicators
- ‚ùå Error messages with details
- üìã Lists of created items with IDs

## Development

### Adding New Content

To add new courses, modules, or content:

1. Edit the respective seeder file
2. Add your data to the data array
3. Run the seeder to populate the database

### Modifying Existing Content

1. Clear existing data: `npm run seed:education:clear`
2. Update the seeder files
3. Re-seed: `npm run seed:education`

This ensures a complete educational experience for testing and development! üéì
