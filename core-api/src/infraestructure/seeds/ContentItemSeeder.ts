A budget is a plan for how you'll spend your money. Here's how to create one:

## Step 1: Calculate Your Income
- Add up all sources of monthly income
- Use your take-home (after-tax) amount
- If income varies, use an average or conservative estimate

## Step 2: List Your Expenses
- Start with fixed expenses
- Add variable expenses
- Don't forget periodic expenses (divide annual costs by 12)
- Include savings as an "expense"

## Step 3: Choose a Budgeting Method

### Zero-Based Budget
Every dollar has a purpose. Income minus expenses should equal zero.

### 50/30/20 Budget
- 50% needs
- 30% wants  
- 20% savings/debt payment

### Envelope Method
Allocate cash for different spending categories in separate envelopes.

## Step 4: Track and Adjust
- Monitor your actual spending
- Compare to your budget
- Make adjustments as needed

Remember: Your first budget won't be perfect. It takes time to get it right!`,

    sequence: 1,
    title: 'Investing vs Saving',
    fileUrl: '',
    markdownBody: `# Investing vs Saving

Understanding the difference between saving and investing is crucial:

## Saving
**Purpose**: Preserve money and provide easy access
**Timeline**: Short-term (less than 5 years)
**Risk**: Very low
**Return**: Low but guaranteed
**Liquidity**: High - easy to access

### Best for:
- Emergency funds
- Short-term goals
- Money you need within 2-3 years

### Common savings options:
- Savings accounts
- Money market accounts
- Certificates of deposit (CDs)

## Investing  
**Purpose**: Grow money over time
**Timeline**: Long-term (5+ years)
**Risk**: Higher but manageable
**Return**: Higher potential returns
**Liquidity**: Lower - may take time to access

### Best for:
- Long-term goals
- Retirement
- Wealth building

### Common investment options:
- Stocks
- Bonds
- Mutual funds
- Real estate

## The Power of Compound Interest

When you invest, you earn returns on both your original money AND on previous returns. This compounding effect can significantly grow your wealth over time.

**Example**: $1,000 invested at 7% annual return:
- After 10 years: $1,967
- After 20 years: $3,870
- After 30 years: $7,612

## Key Takeaway
Save for short-term needs, invest for long-term growth!`,
